# LEAMR 

**LEAMR** (**L**inguistically **E**nriched **AMR**) Alignments
A release of models and data related to alignments between AMR and English text for better parsing and probing of many different linguistic phenomena.

Also see [AMR-utils](https://github.com/ablodge/amr-utils) and the [AMR Bibliography](https://nert-nlp.github.io/AMR-Bibliography/).




# Data

4 types of alignments: **subgraph**, **duplicate subgraph**, **relation**, and **reentrancy** alignments:

- **subgraphs** `<corpus>.subgraph_alignments.json`: alignments of connected DAG-shaped subgraphs to a single span
    - **duplicate subgraphs** includes alignments of connected DAG-shaped subgraphs to a span, where the semantic content is a duplicate of another subgraph (This is usually the result of some linguistic mechanism, such as coordination or ellipsis.)
- **relations** `<corpus>.relation_alignments.json`: alignments of relations to tokens cueing that relation, including argument structures and single relation alignments
- **reentrancies** `<corpus>.reentrancy_alignments.json`: alignments of reentrancy edges to their ``triggers'' for phenomona like coreference, control, and coordination. 


Also `<corpus>.spans.json`: spans for each sentence, grouping tokens which are either named entities or multiword expressions

## JSON Format
The package includes tools for converting AMR alignments from and to JSON like the following.
```
....
```

The advantages of using JSON are:
- Easy to load and save (No need to write a special script for reading some esoteric format)
- Can store additional information in a `type` to distinguish different types of alignments
- Can easily store multiple sets of alignments separately, without needing to modify an AMR file. That makes it easy to compare different sets of alignments. 

To read alignments from a JSON file do:
```
reader = AMR_Reader()
alignments = reader.load_alignments_from_json(alignments_file)
```
To save alignments to a JSON file do:
```
reader = AMR_Reader()
reader.save_alignments_to_json(alignments_file, alignments)
```
